# Introduction

We all have had times where we are scared and hopeless. Even then, we don't give up. We tend to break the barrier and keep going forward. But, what are we pursuing?

# The Problem

This is a world where we create and destroy everything. We create our own problems and solve them ourselves. Everyday, we try to outperform others. Nowadays, we lack empathy. There is little to no connection between us. There is more hatred than love. The greatest of us remain the same while the lower ones suffer. We love and hate our decisions and emotions. We only try to content ourself but not others. We praise and criticize ourself. We never really understand what we are doing.

# The Uncertainty

Events that happen in your life are predictable. The least thing you can predict is "change". Anything that's beyond it, is just in our influence. And that is what makes life beautiful. Every one of us certainly know that there's an end. The next thing that's going to happen, is unknown. It is same for every one of us. Things that happen in our life don't always occur at our wish and will. Our caste, religion, financial status, nothing affects it. Then, why do we keep believing these?

# The Reason

We humans think that we are smart. We always try to assume the outcomes. Our thoughts are impermanent. We change from time to time. All we do is think, rethink, overthink. Ending in nothing but a meaningless question.

"And in the end we are nothing more than love and space dust." - David Jones.

This single line can explain the existence of us. There is an intention behind everything we do. And everything you go down the lane, you simply go down to an emotion called as "love". We might live for ourself or live for others. But whichever you chose, you please yourself by accomplishing it. And there's no way you can deny it. It's the force that keeps us conscious.

# Conclusion

The trail you leave, the impact you create, the effort you send forth is what makes a difference. You need to believe in yourself. Your self-confidence, your self-esteem and your self-motivation is what moves you forward. Keeps you making progress. We don't know how we exist. We don't know why we exist. We don't know what this realm is. We don't know how we are self-aware. But the answer resides deep inside you. No one can teach you this, you cannot learn it by reading. It comes through practice, experience and pain. If you are capable of explaining this, you have the greatest answer of the mankind.
