# Introduction

You might have have already thought about this. Should you hope for the best? Or prepare for the worst?

If we think about this, both ways don't always favour us. It is also impossible to prepare for anything since there are almost infinite possibles.

# Hoping for the best

When you hope for the best, you only rely on a single outcome. It's like always expecting heads while tossing a coin. Not only that you are only "hoping" but not preparing for it. You will be devestated upon happening the worst.

# Preparing for the worst

Preparing for the worst doesn't mean you are expecting worst. You need not to be a pessimist to do this. You could overcome the worst outcomes by preparing for the worst. You should also not be thinking negatively.

# Conclusion

You should also note that the situation affects this. If you are going on a tour, expect for the best. If you are climbing the Mount Everest, prepare for the worst. So in my opinion, it is better to prepare for the worst than hoping for the best. It also wouldn't change the final outcome since you will be prepared. Only your action determines the differenece. So always prepare for the worst, give out all your efforts and hope for the best.
